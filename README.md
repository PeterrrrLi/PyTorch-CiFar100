## PyTorch Models for Neural Net Practices
This is a personal project for my own practices of deep learning, computer vision and their related training techniques. 
Involves my personal practices about models, architectures, loss functions, training optimization methods, and more. 

### Models implemented:
1. AlexNet
2. ResNet 18, 34, 50, 101, 152
3. VGG 11, 13, 16, 19
4. Google Net

### Dataset:
Cifar-100
